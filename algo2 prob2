ALGORITHM Dot_Product
VAR
 ps: a variable used to store the dot product of two vectors
 v1: a variable used to store the first vector
 v2: a variable used to store the second vector
 n: a variable used to store the number of vectors to check
 vectors: a variable used to store a list of vectors to check. Each vector is represented as a list of numbers.
